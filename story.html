                    <h3>2017 - Just like Jesus - LukasTrainer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just like Jesus christ, this channel was created on the 25th of desember.
                        Unlinke Jesus though, my first creation was an unboxing video of the Legend of Zelda monopoly game 
                        wich I has gotten for christmas the day prior. <br><br>
                        I remember very well asking my dad to create an intro for me with Owl Citys Fireflies as the intro song.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="time" style="--wrap-color: #FBCA3E;">
                    <h3>2017 - And then, there was gaming</h3>
                    <p>
                        Later that month, on new years eve, I made a recording set up made by cardboard, a selfie stick and my phone. 
                        Yep, I didnt even record on the playstation, because I didnt have a mic and I because I was stupid. <br><br>
                        This first gaming video of mine was a 15 minute video of me playing Goat Simulator, 
                        I remember very well that my dad laughed at multiplle times while watching. <br><br>
                        You see, at this point I was too young to legally upload anything to YouTube, 
                        so I had to get approval from my parents before uploading anything.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="time" style="--wrap-color: #E24A68;">
                    <h3>2018 - Bragging at school</h3>
                    <p>
                        The moment I came back to school after new years, I told everyone about mye channel. 
                        And something I dont understand today is that, EVERYONE thought it was awesome. 
                        I guess that's because of our generation and how we all grew up with YouTube.

                    <h3>2018 - FORTNITE</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just like everyone else, I had to play fortnite at some point, and that was fun,
                        but at school, I was genuinly begged to stream Fortnite on my YouTube channel.
                        And so I did, and I created multiple videos on it.
                        I even forced my grandparents to try it once.
                    </p>

                <div class="time" style="--wrap-color: #4CADAD;">
                    <h3>2018 - Vlogging</h3>
                    <p>
                        At this time, I also created MANY vlogs, at the start, I basically vlogged everything I did.
                        Since I was a child, all of those vlogs where just whatever my family dragged me into, 
                        like shopping in Sweden or a family dinner at a restaurant where I filmed in the playzone.
                    </p>

                <div class="time" style="--wrap-color: #41516C;">
                    <h3>2019 - The end of an era</h3>
                    <p>
                        Throughout 2018 and the first half of 2019 I continued creating small gaming videos and vlogs, albeit at a smaller pace than before. <br><br>
                        I weren't exactly burning out, but I was growing, and I was beginning to find English YouTube more interesting, 
                        so right before the summer break at the end of elementery school, I completely rebranded my channel to F0RR34L and privated all my older videos.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="time" style="--wrap-color: #FBCA3E;">
                    <h3>2019 - A sad and awkward confession</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the summer break, my channel was empty. It was rebranded and ready, but right now, empty.
                        Because it was empty right? I really wanted to rebrand and didnt want people to watch my old content.
                        <br><br>
                        Here's the thing, on my grandpas tablet, I was logged in to my user, wich I did NOT know.
                        So when me and my sister was sleeping over at his house, she hot into my YouTube studio and watched my videos.
                        When I saw, I thought YouTube's private video function was broken or something, so whithout thinking anything through. 
                        I went on my phone and deleted EVERYTHING.
                        <br><br>
                        So even though I really want to see and share my old cringe videos to the world, 
                        I simply cannot retrieve that big part of my life anymore.

                    <h3>2019 - A new beginning - F0RR34L</h3>
                    <p>
                        Welp, a new beginning in multiple ways, as I was now starting Secondary school.
                        We now also come to the part of my YouTube history that you can actually watch.
                        And it all started with Minecraft, Minecraft sheep torture actually.
                        <br><br>
                        I also finally learned to record and EDIT videos on my playstation, so the quality level went through the roof.
                        Or did it? becuase I weren'n exactly very funny in the start of my channels anglification.
                        I just said Bruh to everything, and I mean EVERYTHING.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2019 -> 2020 - PC Masterrace</h3>
                    <p>
                        For chrsitmas 2019 I finally switched to the PC Masterrace wich obviously was going to change EVERYTHING about this channel.
                        For example create videos such as 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL4seqeotgI" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">No</a> and 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL4seqeotgI" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Yes</a>. My video quality did actually go up though, 
                        and after a bit of learning how I should create videos on PC, the videos weren't half bad, more like quarted bad.
                        <br><br>
                        Since I now could edit in a real software, I also created a lot more stupid shit such as
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bYMwQC-dJo" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">my dog eats you</a> or
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No9-y8Q8-wM&t=77s" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Amazon echo but its number one</a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="time" style="--wrap-color: #4CADAD;">
                    <h3>2020 - I can sing</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 2020, there was this little thing called Coronavirus and a podcast I listened to created a 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHL3JVOomxA" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">sick beat</a> about this.
                        When I searched it up, I found nothing. So I decided to take it into my own hands, and in the first day I got 2k views!
                        Safe to say, if I called this my music that would be cheating. So lets talk about the others.
                        <br><br>
                        On the 18th of december that year, I published 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBstlAx6qt0" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Gamin with a girl</a> 
                        and thats all there is to say about that one. It sucks, and the majority agreed. 
                        <br><br>
                        But I was ready with another song as a little christmas gift. 
                        23rd of december, the world was shook by what could be considered the second coming of christ.
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=925-fYxk-oE" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Cringe christmas</a> was an absolute banger,
                        but not even close to what would later come on this channel...

                    <p>
                        If you ignore the
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8CdkzyL6RA" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Half life</a> and 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8CdkzyL6RA" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Skyrim VR</a> video,
                        2021 was the year where I actually feel my content got good.
                        I feel I finally got a sence of humor and a good work ethic when it came to editing.
                        I even switched my identity again to Lu69as wich is still my name, for now...
                        <br><br>
                        That being said my videos from here an til this day are often far between and I still 
                        never quite got that consistent motivation to create banger videos.

                    <p>
                        I am now going to high school and I got convinced by my friend to buy a steering wheel,
                        wich lets just say kinda took over the channel for a bit.
                        <br><br>
                        I loved and still love racing games, and its such fun videos to create.
                        BUT I still love creating other type of videos, such as the biggest summer hit of 2024,

            <p>
                I take a lot of brakes from YouTube, but I love making these videos.
                Just like William Afton, I allways come back.
                <br><br>
                <b style="display: block; margin-bottom: 10px;">This message is from current me:</b>
                Right now, I have som ideas on videos I want to create, but basically I want the videos to be less special.
                I feel like the need for every video to be a completely new idea is one of the reasons I allways quit. 
                So watch out for more quantity over quality.
