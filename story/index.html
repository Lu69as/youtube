                            <p>
                                Just like Jesus, my channel LukasTrainer was created on December 25th—but instead of miracles, 
                                my first upload was an unboxing of the Zelda Monopoly game I got for Christmas. 
                                I even got my dad to make an intro using Owl City’s Fireflies. 
                                A few days later, on New Year’s Eve, 
                                I recorded my first gaming video, playing Goat Simulator using a setup made of cardboard, a selfie stick, 
                                and my phone (no mic, no capture card, just vibes). I was too young to upload without permission, 
                                so everything went through my parents first.

                            <p>
                                Back at school after New Year’s, I bragged about my channel—and surprisingly, 
                                everyone loved it. I guess growing up with YouTube made it instantly cool. 
                                Like everyone else, I eventually jumped on the Fortnite train, and classmates 
                                literally begged me to stream it—so I did, even making my grandparents try it once. 
                                Around the same time, I dove into vlogging, filming pretty much everything I did—whether 
                                it was shopping in Sweden or running around a restaurant playzone during a family dinner.

                            <p>
                                Through 2018 and early 2019, I kept making small gaming videos and vlogs, though less frequently, 
                                as my interests shifted toward English-speaking YouTubers. Just before summer 
                                break and the end of elementary school, I rebranded my channel to F0RR34L and 
                                privated all my old videos. But during a sleepover at my grandpa’s house, 
                                my sister—unknowingly using <b>my</b> account on his tablet—found and watched my videos. 
                                Thinking YouTube’s private setting had failed, I panicked and deleted everything. 
                                I’ve regretted it since, as those cringey childhood videos are now lost forever—a big piece of my creative history gone for good.

                            <p>
                                Starting secondary school marked a fresh start for me and my YouTube channel, 
                                now rebranded as F0RR34L. The first video in this new era? 
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpNToNwRRQ0&t=28s" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Minecraft sheep torture</a>, obviously. 
                                I finally figured out how to record and edit on my PlayStation, but let’s be honest: 
                                my early content mostly consisted of me saying “bruh” to everything. Christmas 2019 
                                brought the glorious switch to PC, unlocking better video quality and weirder content 
                                like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL4seqeotgI&pp=0gcJCYUJAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">No</a>, 
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8HeyQbLFyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Yes</a> and

                                a pandemic, a beat from a podcast, and my first viral hit: a 
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHL3JVOomxA" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Coronavirus song</a> that hit 2k views in one day. 
                                Later that year, I released the painfully awkward 
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBstlAx6qt0" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Gamin with a girl</a>, and just before Christmas, 
                                I dropped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=925-fYxk-oE&pp=0gcJCYUJAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Cringe Christmas</a>
                                , a track that, while chaotic, was only a warm-up for what was coming next.

                                In 2021, my content finally started to feel genuinely good. 
                                I found my sense of humor, developed a stronger editing style, 
                                and rebranded once again—this time to Lu69as, a name that stuck (at least for now). 
                                This era brought weird and wild experiments like roleplaying a scared soldier in

                                I also hit my first real milestone: 100 subscribers, something I celebrated with full enthusiasm. 
                                While I still struggled with staying consistent, this was the year I truly felt like a creator.

                                I was starting high school when a friend convinced me to buy a steering wheel which, let’s just say, kinda took over the channel 
                                for a bit. I went full throttle into racing content, and I mean only racing content. I made video's like 
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EuCG944m4c&t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">conquering the Nürburgring with a random input "AI"</a>, and recorded my

                                This became the most consistent and focused my channel had ever been, and while the randomness took a slight back seat, 
                                I had finally found a niche that pushed my creativity in a new direction.

                                After months of pure racing content, I began experimenting again. 
                                While iRacing remained central—with long-haul races, dramatic challenges, and 
                                dragging friends into my sim-racing obsession, I also branched out a bit. I reviewed
